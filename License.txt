I place no restrictions on the use of code in this repository (Quantum Pseudo-Telepathy).

That means:
- Attribution not required.
- Commercial use allowed.
- Derivative use allowed.
- Do whatever you want with it.

But note:
- No guarantees (I did my best to ensure correctness, but I am not infallible.).

If you need a 'real' license for obtuse legal reasons, I would be happy to grant it.
