Quantum-Pseudo-Telepathy
========================

Code demonstrating the quantum process used to consistently win a game that can only be won 8 times out of 9 classically.

The code just simulates the quantum circuits that Alice and Bob use to win the game. The general approach is explained in [this blog post](http://twistedoakstudios.com/blog/Post6536_implementing-quantum-pseudo-telepathy).
